Pre-build libraries
-------------------

libkinova_cmd:  Corresponds to Kinova.API.USBCommandLayerUbuntu.so, same code.
libkinova_comm: A copy of Kinova.API.CommLayerUbuntu.so.

The original Kinova.API.CommLayerUbuntu.so is needed by the renamed
libkinova_cmd, as the filename of this library is hard-coded in the binary and
looked for at startup by dlsym calls.
